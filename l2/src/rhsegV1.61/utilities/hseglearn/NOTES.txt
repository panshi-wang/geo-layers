Enable submission of several examples at once.

Add cross at point of selected pixel.

Enable drawing a circle and selecting all region classes within for examples.


Cases:  

-> select positive or negative example - and no conflict - just submit without redoing other examples.

-> select negative example with conflict in the positive examples list:
   must 
      i. zero out the labeling for this region class label
      ii. remove the region class label from the positive examples list
      iii. submit the region class as an ambiguous example.

-> select negative example with conflict in the ambiguous examples list:
   must 
      i. zero out the labeling for this region class label
      ii. remove the region class label from the ambiguous examples list
      iii. submit the region class as a negative example.

-> select positive example with conflict in the negative examples list:
   must 
      i. zero out the labeling for this region class label
      ii. remove the region class label from the negative examples list
      iii. submit the region class as an ambiguous example.

-> select positive example with conflict in the ambiguous examples list:
   must 
      i. zero out the labeling for this region class label
      ii. remove the region class label from the ambiguous examples list
      iii. submit the region class as a positive example.

-> This cannot happen: select positive example with no conflict in examples lists, but with a conflict in display:

-> select negative example with no conflict in examples lists, but with a conflict in display:
   must 
      i. determine positive example region class, 
      ii. save the positive example region class label,
      iii. zero out the labeling for this region class label
      iv. submit the negative example.
      v. resubmit the positive example.

To facilitate this last case (and make the other cases easier), I need to maintain a region class label map.
For the last case, this will enable a straightforward determination of the positive example region class, and
the locations in the labeling that need to be zeroed out.
