
The hsegextract progam can be called in two different manners:

hsegextract

(where the program parameters are entered via a Graphical User Interface)

or

hsegextract parameter_file_name

(where the program parameters are read from a parameter file)

In the later case, "parameter_file_name" is the name of the input parameter
file. For contents see below.

For this help: hsegextract -h or hsegextract -help
For version information: hsegextract -v or hsegextract -version

The (optional) parameter file consists of entries of the form:

-parameter_name parameter_value(s)

The following parameters may be specified in the input parameter file:

-oparam	        	    (string)	HSeg/RHSeg output parameter file
					(required)
-hseg_level	(short unsigned int)	Hierarchical segmentation level at which
					the selected feature values are extracted.
					(required)

One or more of the following are required:

-class_labels_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the class labels map
					extracted at the selected
					hierarchical segmentation level.
-class_npix_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the class # of pixels map
					extracted at the selected
					hierarchical segmentation level.
-class_mean_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the class mean feature map
					extracted at the selected
					hierarchical segmentation level.
-class_std_dev_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the class standard
					deviation feature map extracted at the
					selected hierarchical segmentation level.
-class_bpratio_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the class boundary pixel
					ratio feature map extracted at the
					selected hierarchical segmentation level.
-class_shapefile_ext       (string)	Base file name for the class shapefile
					to contain the segmentation information
					extracted at the selected hierarchical
					segmentation level.
-object_labels_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the object labels map
					extracted at the selected
					hierarchical segmentation level.
-object_npix_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the object # of pixels map
					extracted at the selected
					hierarchical segmentation level.
-object_mean_map_ext	    (string)	File name for the object mean feature map
					extracted at the selected
					hierarchical segmentation level.
-object_std_dev_map_ext     (string)	File name for the object standard
					deviation feature map extracted at the
					selected hierarchical segmentation level.
-object_bpratio_map_ext     (string)	File name for the object boundary pixel
					ratio feature map extracted at the
					selected hierarchical segmentation level.
-object_shapefile_ext       (string)	Base file name for the object shapefile
					to contain the segmentation information
					extracted at the selected hierarchical
					segmentation level.

NOTE: The "object" files will be ignored if the
"object_labels_map" is not specified in the HSeg/RHSeg output parameter file
(-oparam above).


NOTE: If the "object_labels_map" is specified, a region class
shapefile cannot be produced without an accompanying region object shapefile.
