The rhseg progam can be called in two different manners:

rhseg

(where the program parameters are entered via a Graphical User Interface)

or

rhseg parameter_file_name

(where the program parameters are read from a parameter file)

In the later case, "parameter_file_name" is the name of the input parameter
file. For contents see below.

For this help: rhseg -h or rhseg -help

For version information: rhseg -v or rhseg -version

The (optional) parameter file consists of entries of the form:

-parameter_name parameter_value(s)

This must be the first entry in the parameter file:
-program_mode		(string)	Program Mode - Valid values are:
					  HSWO,
					  HSEG, or 
					  RHSEG.
					 (default = RHSEG)

The following parameters may be specified in the input parameter file:

-mask			(string)	Input data mask file name (optional,
					 default = {none})
-std_dev_image		(string)	Input standard deviation image file

					clustering versus region growing

The following optional parameters specify the scaling of the input image data:
